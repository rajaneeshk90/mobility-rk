# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Ride hailing through Public Digital Infrastructure

Ride-hailing services, seamlessly integrated into the public digital infrastructure using protocols like Beckn, mark a groundbreaking shift in urban mobility. Beckn, as a scalable and secure framework, facilitates a dynamic connection between riders, drivers, and urban planning entities. This protocol empowers cities to optimize transportation systems by fostering interoperability among various service providers. The protocol introduces transparency into the ride-hailing experience, providing users with insights into pricing, driver ratings, and safety measures.

## 1.2 Beckn Protocol: A Primer

The Beckn Protocol serves as a foundational layer for this digital infrastructure. It is an open protocol that allows businesses across any industry to be discovered and engaged by any Beckn-enabled application. The protocol is a collection of open specifications consisting of APIs, message formats, network design, and reference architectures. It enables server-to-server communication, allowing consumer-facing platforms to discover and transact with any business with minimal implementation overhead. The protocol decouples the demand and supply sides, enabling services to be available on any online consumer interface that has mainstream adoption in a city (source).

## 1.3 Mobility Protocol

Mobility is an adaptation of Beckn Protocol tailored for the ride hailing service. It provides a set of configurable, extendable, modular open-source digital building blocks. Platforms offering services in retail can implement Mobility specification to ensure seamless discovery of opportunities and trust in transactions.

## 1.4 Key Digital Functionalities of Beckn Mobility enabled platforms

1. Discovery: Discovery of vehicles available in that area for rides.
1. Fulfillment: Assignement of a vehicle to the user.
1. Post-Fulfillment: Handles activities like payemnt, rating, feedback, support, and issuing of verifiable credentials.


## 1.5 Transporting Verifiable Credentials: Enhancing Trust and Reliability

One of the most transformative aspects of the Beckn Protocol and Mobility is the ability to transport verifiable credentials securely. This feature is particularly crucial in mobility sector, where the verification of the providers is paramount. By embedding these credentials within the protocol, customers can instantly verify the authenticity of the providers, thereby greatly enhancing the trust and reliability of transactions.

## 1.6 Benefits of a Unified Digital Infrastructure

1. Reduced Information Asymmetry: A common protocol allows for standardized information sharing, reducing gaps in knowledge and expectations.
1. Cost-Effective Trust Verification: The protocol's inherent security features minimize the cost of trust verification.
1. Enhanced Discoverability: The infrastructure allows for the seamless discovery of opportunities across multiple platforms.
1. Portability: Users can easily switch between different service providers without losing their data or trust credentials.

## 1.7 Conclusion


Embracing mobility as an integral component of our public digital infrastructure holds the potential to reshape the way we navigate our modern world. This scalable, secure, and efficient mobility platform seamlessly connects various stakeholders, unlocking opportunities for a frictionless exchange in diverse realms such as transportation, urban planning, and digital connectivity. Through fostering innovation and collaboration, mobility becomes a catalyst for overcoming challenges and paving the way for transformative solutions. This approach not only enhances efficiency and accessibility in transportation but also contributes to a more interconnected and sustainable urban ecosystem. By leveraging the power of mobility as a public digital infrastructure, we have the means to revolutionize our cities, making them more adaptive, resilient, and responsive to the dynamic needs of the communities they serve.
