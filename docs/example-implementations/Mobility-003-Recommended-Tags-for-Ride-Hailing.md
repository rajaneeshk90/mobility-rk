## Solution
### Tag Groups
Tag groups are labels under which various tags can be grouped. In the mobility sector, Tag Groups can contains various service-specific information. Tag Groups can be standardized at a domain-level or a network-level depending upon implementer demand for standardizations. Some examples of Tag Groups are shown below. 

Note: The below list is NOT a recommended or required standard. This list will be standardized on the basis of adoption by implementers. 

## Examples:
| Example Name `(groups/[index]/descriptor.name)` | Example Code `groups/[index]/descriptor.code` | Description                                                                                            |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Localization                            | locale                                | adapting a software product to the linguistic, cultural and technical requirements of a target market. |
| Fare Policy                             | fare_policy                           | Fare calculation rules for a mobility service                                                          |
| General Information                     | general_info                          | Any information that is applicable to a product, service, or category                                  |
| Route Information                       | route_info                            | Information applicable to a specific route 

# Tags

Tags are used to transmit product-specific attributes. Mobility service providers can send these values to describe attributes related to fare policies, product features, commercials etc. Tags can be used by BAPs to create filters, to allow sorting, comparison etc. Tags can also be used by BPPs for catalog indexing.

**Note:** The above tag list is NOT a recommended or required standard. This list will be standardized on the basis of adoption by implementers across multiple networks. 


## Contributing to Tags
Tags are standardized by the Mobility Working Group on the basis of community adoption. At the current moment, there are no standard tags recommended by the working group. Eventually a tag list will be created that looks like the table below. Implementers are free to submit tags for consideration via a PR with a row added to the table below along with an attached report on adoption of that tag across the implementer community. It is recommended for contributors to do extensive research on adoption before submitting the PR.
